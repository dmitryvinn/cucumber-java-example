# Cucumber Example - Java

## Overview
As a part of the talk, [Gauge+Taiko: BDD for Web Revived](https://dvinnik.com/talks/testing/gauge-taiko-bdd-for-web-revived/), we discuss basics of BDD (aka, Behavior Driven Development).
Nowadays, there is no BDD-praticioner who has not worked with Cucumber as some point in time. This fact highlights the importance of Cucumber for those who just start learning BDD, or needs to refresh their memory.

In this demo, Cucumber is used with Java platform to run a test suite for one of the sample apps from [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/examples/angularjs/#/).
